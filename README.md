# Social-Network-express

This is my repository for a project I made to show of my frontend skills and understanding of the backend. Communication to the database and backend API was enabled by using [mockAPI](https://mockapi.io/) platform, but serving of the pages are made using express. Project was done using OOP, and no React or EJS.

## This app is completely usable SOCIAL NETWORK with fitures such ass specific login, editing username and pasword, creating posts, commenting and liking posts.


Here are the inteface of the login page and registration modal.
